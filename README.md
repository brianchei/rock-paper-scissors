# rock-paper-scissors
Welcome to my rock, paper, scissors game! This project is a variation of the assignment provided by The Odin Project: Project: Rock Paper Scissors. Recreating this traditional game in javascript was my first interactive project in javascript and I had a great opportunity to practice my skills and knowledge. Some of the tools I utilized include, but are not limited to: functions, loops, error handling, debugging, iterative problem solving, Chrome DevTools, and operators. There are minor changes to the project, but it functions as intended and I hope to add on to it in the future!
